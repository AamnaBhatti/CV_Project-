Here we have provided some samples to have a feel of the data. However our handwritten Urdu numerals dataset is unique and any such dataset is not available publicly. It is refined and was collected on the lines of MNIST dataset so we have not made it public as of yet. It has our copyrights and anyone who wants to produce competent results can contact us for its access.
