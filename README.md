Urdu is a complex language as it is an amalgam of many South Asian and East Asian languages; hence character recognition of Urdu is a huge and difficult task. We have systematically studied a recognition problem of handwritten Urdu digits. 
Our contribution is as follows:
1)  Firstly  we  visualize  our  dataset  using  PCA,  t-SNE  anda combination of PCA+t-SNE

2)  We apply 3 different architecture combinations namely:
* ResNet version 1 and version 2
* ResNet   version   1   with   Squeeze   and   Excitation block,  ResNet  version  2  with  Squeeze  and  Exci-tation block
* ResNet  version  1  with  Convolutional  Block  Atten-tion  Module,  ResNet  version  2  with  ConvolutionalBlock Attention Module3)  
*Lastly we visualized feature maps to understand what islearned in them
